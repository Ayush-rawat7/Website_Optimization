# Website_Optimization
A python based project.
This project investigates website optimization through a data-driven approach using Python, focusing on key metrics that impact user engagement, site performance, and conversion rates. The primary objective is to analyze web analytics data, including metrics such as session counts, user engagement time, traffic sources, and events per session, to identify areas for enhancing user experience and increasing site efficiency. The dataset, structured to include date-time, user, session, and engagement metrics, is processed and visualized using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib etc.
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and aggregation of user and session data by date and channel, this project provides insights into traffic trends, engagement rates, and conversion opportunities. These insights allow for recommendations on improving site performance, such as optimizing page load times, tailoring content to high-engagement channels, and enhancing conversion points. This report highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and optimization to adapt to user behavior and sustain growth in competitive digital environments.
